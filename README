NS2Update
by: Brian "devicenull" Rak

This tool will automatically keep a NS2 server update to date.  It will query for an update every 5 minutes, and if one is found will kill the server and start HldsUpdateTool

FEATURES:
* Automatic updates
* Automatic restart on crash
* Server logs archived
* Performance graphs (cpu, memory, tickrate, players)

INSTALLATION:
1) Grab everything in the "dist" (or dist_x64, if you run a 64 bit OS) directory, and upload it to your server.
2) In whatever script you use to start the server, replace 'Server.exe' with 'ns2update.exe'. (If you don't use a script, just start ns2update.exe instead of Server.exe)
3) There is no further configuration necssary (nor is there any that can be done)

Once the tool is running, it will automatically start your server up, then check for updates every 5 minutes.  It will check that the server is still running every 5 seconds, and restart it if it has crashed.

Every 5 minutes the cpu/memory/tickrate/players will be recorded and a graph generated.  This graph will be saved to ns2server.png in the same directory as Server.exe.  NOTE: tickrate will only be recorded if you are running NS2GmOvermind.  The stock server does not have any way to retrieve this information.

CONFIGURATION:
The tool will check the server directory and it's parent directory for hldsupdatetool.exe.  If you have it somewhere else, create a ns2update.cfg file in your server directory.  Put the full path (include hldsupdatetool.exe) to the update tool on the first line.

This tool can optionally restart your server when it goes from full -> empty (Useful due to the resource leaks in NS2).  To enable this, add "--restartwhenempty" to your command line.  Note that if you are running the server on something other then the default IP/port, you must set the IP and port using the "-ip X.X.X.X -port 27016" command line arguments in order to make use of this feature.

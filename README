NS2Update
by: Brian "devicenull" Rak

This tool will automatically keep a NS2 server update to date.  It will query for an update every 5 minutes, and if one is found will kill the server and start HldsUpdateTool

FEATURES:
* Automatic updates
* Automatic restart on crash
* Server logs archived

INSTALLATION:
1) Grab everything in the "dist" directory, and upload it to your server.
2) In whatever script you use to start the server, replace 'Server.exe' with 'ns2update.exe'. (If you don't use a script, just start ns2update.exe instead of Server.exe)
3) There is no further configuration necssary (nor is there any that can be done)

Once the tool is running, it will automatically start your server up, then check for updates every 5 minutes.  It will check that the server is still running every 5 seconds, and restart it if it has crashed.
